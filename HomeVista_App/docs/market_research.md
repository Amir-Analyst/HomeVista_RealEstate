>    - AI research was guided by the manual baseline patterns from locations 1-2
>    - This approach significantly reduced time investment while maintaining data quality
> 
> 3. **Cross-Verification**:

>    - Data points matched Property Finder listings (November 2025)

## Tips for Efficient Research

1. **Use Property Finder Filters**: Select "Rent", choose neighborhood, filter by property type
2. **Look for Patterns**: After 5-6 listings, you'll see typical ranges
3. **Note Outliers**: Exceptionally high/low prices (penthouse vs. older building)
4. **Check Map View**: See proximity to metro, beach, major landmarks
5. **Read Descriptions**: Amenities, building age, community features
