# 🎥 HomeVista Project Demo Script
**Duration:** ~3 Minutes

---

## 1. Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
*   **Visual**: Face camera or Title Slide.
*   **Script**: 
    > "Hi, I'm Amir. Finding a fair rental price in Dubai can be overwhelming. Prices fluctuate wildly between neighborhoods, and it's hard to know if you're getting a good deal. 
    >
    > That's why I built **HomeVista**—an AI-powered rental intelligence dashboard. It uses advanced machine learning to predict fair market rents with **99.7% accuracy**, helping tenants avoid overpaying and landlords optimize their pricing."

## 2. The Tech Stack (0:30 - 0:45)
*   **Visual**: Show "Model Performance" section of the dashboard (R² Score, MAPE).
*   **Script**:
    > "Under the hood, HomeVista runs on a robust 4-model ensemble featuring **XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest**. I trained this on over **16,000 listings** across Dubai, engineering 58 distinct features to capture everything from location tiers to amenity impact."

## 3. Demo: Tenant Tool (0:45 - 1:30)
*   **Visual**: Navigate to **Tenant Tool**. Enter details for a "2BR in Dubai Marina". Enter a high price (e.g., 200k).
*   **Script**:
    > "Let's say I'm a tenant looking at a 2-bedroom apartment in Dubai Marina listed for 200,000 AED. I enter the details here... and hit predict.
    >
    > The AI instantly analyzes the market and tells me... **'Overpriced'**. The fair rent is actually around 160,000 AED. It even gives me a confidence range and negotiation tips based on comparable data."

## 4. Demo: Landlord Tool (1:30 - 2:15)
*   **Visual**: Navigate to **Landlord Tool**. Enter details for a "1BR in Business Bay".
*   **Script**:
    > "Now, flipping the script. If I'm a landlord in Business Bay, I want to maximize my ROI. 
    >
    > The **Landlord Tool** doesn't just give me a price; it gives me a *strategy*. It suggests a 'Quick Lease' price to fill the unit in 2 weeks, or a 'Premium' price if I can wait. 
    >
    > It even suggests upgrades—look here, it says furnishing this unit could add 15,000 AED to my annual revenue."

## 5. Demo: Market Explorer (2:15 - 2:45)
*   **Visual**: Navigate to **Market Explorer**. Show the charts.
*   **Script**:
    > "Finally, for analysts, the **Market Explorer** visualizes the entire ecosystem. We can see rent distributions by neighborhood, the premium for luxury tiers, and exactly how much value a swimming pool or metro access adds to a property."

## 6. Conclusion (2:45 - 3:00)
*   **Visual**: Face camera or Contact Slide.
*   **Script**:
    > "HomeVista bridges the gap between complex data and actionable decisions. It's not just a calculator; it's a complete market intelligence system. Thank you for watching."
